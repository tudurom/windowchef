.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Here is a list of exposed properties:
.
.TP
\fBWINDOWCHEF_ACTIVE_GROUPS\fR

.
.TP
\fBcolor_focused\fR, \fBcolor_unfocused\fR \fIcolor\fR
Sets the border color to \fIcolor\fR for the focused and unfocused state respectively\. \fIcolor\fR is a hexadecimal value that may or may not start with \fB0x\fR prefix\. Example: \fB0x1234ef\fR\.

.
.TP
\fBgroups_nr\fR \fInr\fR

.
.TP
\fBenable_resize_hints\fR \fIBOOL\fR
If true, \fBwindowchef\fR will respect window resize hints as defined by ICCCM\. Most terminal emulators should have this feature\.

Enable sloppy focus\.
.
.TP
\fBsticky_windows\fR \fIBOOL\fR

.
.TP
\fBenable_last_window_focusing\fR \fIBOOL\fR
If true, when the currently focused window is unmapped or closed, \fBwindowchef\fR will focus the previously focused window\. See the \fBwindow_focus_last\fR command\.

If true, then some settings will be applied on all windows instead of newly created windows\. True by default\.
.
.TP
\fBreplay_click_on_focus\fR \fIBOOL\fR
